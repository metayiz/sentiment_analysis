This is a sentiment analysis project developed for the LING 360 course at Boğaziçi University.

The objective of this project is to analyze text data and determine the sentiment or emotional tone.
It involves classifying text into categories such as positive and negative, to gauge the overall sentiment expressed.
Sentiment analysis holds significant importance across various domains, including politics, the movie industry, and product marketing.
For instance, politicians can benefit from sentiment analysis by understanding public opinions on their proposed campaigns, aiding them in making informed decisions.
Similarly, brands can employ sentiment analysis to gauge customer feedback regarding their products or brand experience.

Given the vast volume of user-generated content on platforms like Twitter, sentiment analysis models play a crucial role in efficiently processing and understanding public sentiment.
With approximately 500 million tweets posted daily, manually analyzing each tweet would be impractical.
By utilizing sentiment analysis models, insights can be derived from these tweets, allowing organizations and individuals to gain a better understanding of public opinion.

Sentiment analysis enables the automatic classification of text into sentiment categories, aiding in understanding public sentiment across various domains.
By leveraging sentiment analysis models, valuable insights can be extracted from vast amounts of textual data, facilitating decision-making processes
	in politics,
	the movie industry,
	product marketing,
	and beyond.

This project, from data collection to coding to deciding on what model to use, was developed by Muhammed Emir Tayız.
